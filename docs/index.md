## Preparation

Before starting the game a test calibration is accomplished. This test zeros every motor in order to function right. The teams get selected.

## Game-goal

Get more points than the other team to win the game.

## Game-history

Every player gets assigned to a turret with the associated controller. The players try to shoot the rotating object by controlling the turret with the controller (see coontroller settings). For every hit the players get points. The team with the most points after the round finishes wins. One player can only shoot ... time when the object is passing. Afterwards the turret needs to cool down. When a player shoots the red LED on the turret lights up. After hitting the target the green LED lights up.

## Game-end

The game ends as soon as the time is over. The points are evaluated and the team with the more points win.
